# WHAT IS UNIX?
UNIX is a powerful, multi-user and multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s at Bell Labs by AT&T. It's known for its robustness and flexibility, and it's used primarily in servers, workstations, and mainframes.

# Why Learn UNIX?
- UNIX provides a variety of powerful tools and utilities that can be combined in unique ways to perform complex tasks. This makes it a very flexible and efficient     
  operating system.
- Knowledge of UNIX can help you write shell scripts to automate tasks, which can save a lot of time and effort.
- Many jobs, especially in the IT and software development sectors, require or prefer knowledge of UNIX. It's used extensively in servers, mainframes, and workstations in many industries.
- UNIX forms the basis for many other operating systems, including Linux and MacOS. So, learning UNIX can make it easier to understand and use these systems.
-  UNIX has strong built-in networking functions, making it ideal for network administration and internet use.
-  UNIX is known for its robust security features, which is another reason it's favored in professional and academic settings.
- UNIX systems are highly portable, meaning they can run on many different kinds of hardware.
- There is a large community of UNIX users who can provide support and share their knowledge.
Remember, while UNIX itself may not be as commonly used on personal computers, many of its principles and commands are applicable to other systems, especially Linux. So, learning UNIX can provide a strong foundation for working with various operating systems.
